The MQLC model is referenced from the repository available at https://github.com/angmavrogiannis/B-GAP-Behavior-Guided-Action-Prediction-and-Navigation-for-Autonomous-Driving. 

Built upon the B-GAP model, the MQLC model is designed to realize multi-agent joint lane-changing decision-making through three core enhancements: more optimized observation mechanisms, improved neural network architectures, and more cooperative judgment strategies. For a detailed elaboration on its relevant innovations, please refer to the academic paper accessible at https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09755.
